## Objectives
1. Investigate the cross-section (σ) of the ¹²C + ¹²C → ²⁴Mg reaction in the center-of-mass energy range 1–5 MeV.
2. Determine the astrophysical S-factor as a function of energy.
3. Analyze resonant structures or enhancements in reaction yield.
4. Compare experimental data with theoretical predictions or literature values.
